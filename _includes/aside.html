              <p>7 years ago, 4 witches, 2 elfs, and an unsuspecting farm boy slayed a pig in the shadow of a Yolo County barn and proclaimed it to be Halloweezy 1: Donkeypocalypse. Since then we've been gored by the Poltergoat, hexed by the Wiccan Chickens, and cuckolded by the Apocalypse Cow (she's a looker).</p>
