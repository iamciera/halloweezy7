              <h3>About</h3>  ON THIS YEAR, the 7th year of the Weezy, the 7 gates of hell creak open to reveal the most blood-curdling being of them all: ‚ò†Ô∏èüêèTHE GRIM SHEEPER. Come if you dare, for the GOAT team has some new tricks up our hooves. DRINK vile potions and the blood of innocents, please support our gracious hosts and help us make this a sustainable event by bellying up to the Stingrayz bar. You may also search out the Spookeazy, but rumor has it that those who find it are never the same.</p>

              <p>7 years ago, 4 witches, 2 elfs, and an unsuspecting farm boy slayed a pig in the shadow of a Yolo County barn and proclaimed it to be Halloweezy 1: Donkeypocalypse. Since then we've been gored by the Poltergoat, hexed by the Wiccan Chickens, and cuckolded by the Apocalypse Cow (she's a looker).</p>
